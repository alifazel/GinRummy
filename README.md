# GinRummy

## Objectives

* Implementing AI logic for a computer GinRummy opponent 
* Implementing card shuffling and dealing algorithm programatically
* Using the Java standard library in a project

## Description of project
 
Extended a previous Java project for modelling a deck of cards by adding a class to model a game of GinRummy. This involved coding an algorithm for dealing a pack of cards, AI logic for a computer opponent and scoring system. This was part of my introduction to object oriented programming in Java. I learned a great deal about object encapsulation and polymorphism as concepts in Object Oriented Programming and was introduced to the Java standard library.
